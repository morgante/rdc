This was a typical status update meeting.

### Meeting with IT
The upcoming meeting with NYUAD IT (2012-10-08 16:30 GST) was discussed. It was decided to be diplomatic and respect concerns, but continue to pursue the creation of these projects. In particular, highlight the experience-building aspect and the willingness to fail.

### GitHub
The GitHub organization plan has been purchase for one month. An architecture was agreed upon.

-   New projects will exist as private repositories, based on the [template](https://github.com/nyuadsg/template). All associated material will be included, either in the admin branch or as issues.
-   Project wikis will not be used.
-   Project issues will be used as a form of a todo list and include tasks, issues, and feature requests.
-   An "rdc" repository will be used to house the administrative work of the R&D committee.
-   Planned/requested projects will be filed as issues on the rdc committee repo.

### Student Government
We have not received information on approval of the budget. A copy will be placed in the R&D committee repo. Both Mandy Tan and Brett Bolton should receive accounts and training for GitHub.
