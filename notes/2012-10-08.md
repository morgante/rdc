Meeting with David Tinagero (Student Life) and Joel Leimer (Web Services)

### General Update for David and Joel
Went through the structure and goals of the committee with David and Joel, explained
expectations in terms of our work and the projects we've currently accumulated.


### Connection with Web Services
We will set aside a time to meet with Joel every other week to update Web Services 
on our projects. This allows for us to be aware of any conflicting projects that are
close to being deployed and receive help when needed with either data acquisition
or resources we might need.
