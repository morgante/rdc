This was a brief status update meeting.

### GitHub
Brett received training in using GitHub and the structure was outlined.
A possibility of deploying it more widely for student government was discussed, if it works well for RDC.

### Budget
Brett does not have a copy of the RDC budget, but will upload one to GitHub and share.

### Executive Board
Given the number of things the RDC is working on, Brett would like @morgante and @jfbeltran to attend an executive board meeting this coming Friday.
